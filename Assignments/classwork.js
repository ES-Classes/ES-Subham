/* ## Arjun wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 10% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 15%.

## Your tasks:
1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value.
2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value
(bill + tip). Example: 
    >“The bill was Rs. 200, the tip was Rs. 20, and the total is Rs. 220”
## Test data:
* Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430 */

function tip(n)
{
    if(n > 50 && n < 300)
    {
    return n * .10;
    }

    return n * .15;
}

let x = 250;
console.log(tip(x));

console.log('The bill was:',x,', The tip was:',tip(x),',The total was:',x+tip(x));
